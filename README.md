📊 An **interactive data analysis project** built with **Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** to explore healthcare costs, patient demographics, disease burden, hospital efficiency, and insurance impact.  

---

## 📂 Project Files
- `Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard.ipynb`
- `Healthcare Data Analysis.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook with complete analysis & visualizations  
- `Health_Care.csv` → Dataset used for analysis  

---

## 🔍 Key Objectives
- Analyze hospital costs and efficiency.  
- Identify disease burden and treatment patterns.  
- Study patient demographics (age, stay duration, doctor visits).  
- Evaluate impact of insurance coverage.  
- Explore outcomes (recovery, readmission, death) on costs.  

---

## 📊 Insights & Results
- **Highest Avg Cost Hospital** → *Specialty Center* (~12,106)  
- **Costliest Age Group** → *51 years* (~13,498)  
- **Longest Avg Hospital Stay** → *Diabetes patients* (~20.4 days)  
- **Most Expensive Outcome** → *Dead* (~12,161)  
- **Doctor Visits Correlation** → *No strong correlation with cost*  
- **Insurance Impact** → *Insurance covers majority of costs (~12,002)*  

---

## ✅ Business Recommendations
1. Focus on **preventive care for chronic diseases** like Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Cancer.  
2. Share **best practices** from hospitals with lower average treatment costs.  
3. Improve **elderly patient management** to reduce length of stay.  
4. Collaborate with **insurance providers** to optimize healthcare policies.  
5. Reduce **readmissions** with strong follow-up programs.
